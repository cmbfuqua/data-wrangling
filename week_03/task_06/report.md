In this graph, I have put the start and the end amounts on the graph, with the actual numerical change as a bar graph underneath. There is always an increase in the number of viewers, and for seasons 3-7 there was a big increase in the number of viewers. Something happened though in the last 3 seasons where they didn't have a huge spike and the number of viewers significantly dropped.

It is interesting to see here how right before the finale the number of viewers drops below or to the mean. look at seasons 4-6 for a good representation of this. Also, as in the previous chart, we see there to be significantly less viewers in the final 3 seasons of the show. The last 3 seasons stay right around 10 million viewers where as seasons 5-7 all peak around 14 million+.
