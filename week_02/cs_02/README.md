There are basic questions that data can answer
- What caused the change
- What can we do next
- What is the most influencial variable in this dataset
- Where did the biggest change occur
- Do I have viable data?

When I was talking to some of my coworkers, they liked my questions. We talked about how data can answer most any question within the scope of the data. You can't ask how many dogs in the US when you have data about flights, is one example of it being outisde of the scope. But, if we were to ask a question like 'why are there late flights coming from the east?' then the data could probably answer that question, if the data is viable. 

We also talked about the basic questions to ask and those where you standard KPIs of the data, and those varry depending on the project but they normally have things to do with the change over time, the sum of something and the average. Sometimes even a custom formula for certain companies.  

Here is an article that goes over the KPIs of data quality https://www.cc-cdq.ch/Data-management-glossary/data-quality-KPI. 
I liked this article because it address the different types of KPIs that a company could have to demonstrate the success of their company.
