# Background
One of the things I learned while making this chart is how to adjust the width of the chart. It is pretty simple in altair, all you do is add a .properties(width = , height = ). Another thing I learned is how to change the legend title, again you just add an argument of 'title = ' and then list your title and that's it! the power behind these graphing tools is amazing!
